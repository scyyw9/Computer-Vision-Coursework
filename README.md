## Computer Vision Coursework: Person Tracking

### Installation
The code has been tested on Python 3.9 and PyTorch 1.11.1+Cuda 11.3. Please follow the instructions to setup your environment. See other required packages in `requirements.txt`.

### Tracking
Please place the video files you want to track people in the directory called 'videos'. In the `main.py` file, change the input video file name to the one you want to test. Run the `main.py` file, and the results will be saved in a directory named 'output'.

### Customizing Paths
You can modify the paths used to read the input video and output the results in the `main.py` file.
